4. The application must give users the option to sort movies
5. The application must use Parcel as its build tool

7. The application must be written with React Redux
8. The application must use Bootstrap as a UI library for styling and responsiveness
9. The application must contain a mix of class components and function components
10. The application may be hosted online
